# Smart Contract Data Analyzer

## Overview

The Smart Contract Data Analyzer is a powerful tool designed to analyze data from smart contracts. Using a robust tech stack, this tool provides insights and detailed analysis to help users make informed decisions. The project leverages Python, Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy, and Microsoft Excel to deliver comprehensive data analysis and visualization.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Extract and preprocess data from smart contracts.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform in-depth analysis using Pandas and NumPy.
- **Visualization**: Create visual representations of data for better insights.
- **Export to Excel**: Export analyzed data to Microsoft Excel for further manipulation and reporting.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Jupyter**: For creating and sharing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For exporting and further analyzing data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (v3.8 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Microsoft Excel

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-contract-data-analyzer.git
    cd smart-contract-data-analyzer
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Analyzer

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.

2. **Open the Analysis Notebook**:
    In the Jupyter interface, navigate to `SmartContractDataAnalyzer.ipynb` and open it.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
    Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the analysis. You can execute cells individually to see step-by-step results.

### Exporting Data to Excel

After running the analysis, you can export the results to an Excel file by running the provided export functions in the notebook. This will generate an Excel file with your analyzed data for further use.

### Key Components

- **`data/`**: Contains raw and processed data files.
- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis.
- **`scripts/`**: Contains Python scripts for data extraction, analysis, and visualization.
