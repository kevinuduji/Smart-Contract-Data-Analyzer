# Smart-Contract-Risk-Analysis

## ** All Data Found using an accumulated data set of the other 53 externs accepted into the program **
### * We had also came up with a conclusion(not in my slides) for the premade data set 'webacy_risk_dataset' *

## Frequency Analysis
Frequency Python Notebook (in Google Colab/Jupyter) is where I got a visuals for the bar graphs
 - Later put into Google Sheets to get a graph of easy reability

## Cluster Analysis
Used Python Notebook (in Google Colab/Jupyter) to get both my heatmap and cluster graphs
